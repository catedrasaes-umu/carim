 - carimModel.emf: EMF design and Java implementation of CARIM.

 - instantiator: framework to put interaction data (extracted, e.g., using the AHE11 https://github.com/pedromateo/android-hci-extractor-AHE11) into CARIM model instances. The process of creating and filling instances is automatic. See examples below.

 - lunar-test and lunar-test-2: examples of Android applications integrating CARIM to implement analysis
